Identifer  
 • Boolen variable has only two possible state 0,1 
 • Floating point :decimal point after the number 
 • .L is long double 
 • Constant expression such 3+7+9.2 evaluated at compile time and replaced single constant 19.2 
 • Sizeof('Z') will equally 4 not 1 
 •  Sizeof("Z") will equally 2 not 1 because it means Z\0 
  
 Type specifier 
 1. Singed : my have negative value ans MSB is its sign-bit and the value encoded in 2's complement binary 
 2. Unsigned: non negative  
 3. Int default signed but char default unsigned 
 4. Short ===signed short int 
 5. signed/unsigned===signed int 
  
 ________ 
 Type qualifier 
  
 • Const qualifier:store in Rom  
 • Volatile qualifier:ex Empty delay loop 
  
_____ 
 1. Shift right: Add zero in MSB and delete bit from LSB  
 2. Shift left: Add zero in LSB and delete bit from MSB  
_______ 
  
 • Scope: describe the visibility of the identifier within the program /local and External 
 • Extent :the lifetime, when memory allocate to store it and when memory is released 
 _____ 
 • Extern : declaration/ and we use it in multi file project  
  ___ 
 
 • Static with global variables : the variable can not seen outside the file (become file scope) 
 • Static with local variables: the variable will be stored in .datat in RAM and ROM ( it's lifetime will be the same as the project )
